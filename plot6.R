## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
## ====================
## Script for plot6.png

# This project performs the following steps:
# - Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
# - Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.
# - Create a separate R code file plot1.R, plot2.R that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png. 
#   Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. 
#   You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.
# - Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository (no need for separate sub-folders)

# Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor 
# vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037").

# 24510 is Baltimore, see plot2.R, 06037 is LA CA
# Searching for ON-ROAD type in NEI
# Don't actually know it this is the intention, but searching for 'motor' in SCC only gave a subset (non-cars)
