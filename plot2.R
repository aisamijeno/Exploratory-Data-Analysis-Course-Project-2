## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
## ====================
## Script for plot2.png

# This project performs the following steps:
# - Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
# - Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.
# - Create a separate R code file plot1.R, plot2.R that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png. 
#   Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. 
#   You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.
# - Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository (no need for separate sub-folders)

# Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? 
# Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.
